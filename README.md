Welcome to the **HTML to MAML Converter** project.

This tool is used to convert legacy HTML topic files to MAML topics along with their supporting project files so
that they can be used with current releases of the [Sandcastle Help File Builder](https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB)
project.

This project used to be part of the help file builder project.  However, given that it has been many years since
the help file builder transitioned to MAML topics for its conceptual content, this tool has been moved into its
own standalone project and is no longer distributed with the help file builder.

For more information, see the [HTML to MAML Converter documentation](https://ewsoftware.github.io/HtmlToMamlDocs).
